	<h1>Why We Matter</h1>
	<br>
	<h4>Vegitarian cuisine is a critical aspect of a healthy life, even for non-vegitarians. Here are ways it affects your life and the world around you.</h4>
<br>
	<h2>Your health</h2>
	<p>A vegitarian or vegan diet can improve your heart health, prevent cancer, lower blood pressure, reduce risk of diabetes, and promote bone health. Along with this, you are ingesting less toxins ingested along the food chain and more antioxidants, which prevent digestive decay. More vegetarian dishes incorporated into your diet will also contain more dietary fibers, which will help digestion and keep you satiated throughout the day.</p>
	
	<h3>Your Heart</h3>
	<p>Vegitarian and vegan diets are associated with a reduction in bad cholesterol, insulin levels, and body weight, all of which confirm the benefits of plant based diets on the heart. More specifically, these changes are associated with fruits, vegetables, and certain beans, while, though they are vegan, fried foods and some nuts have negative effects. While some of these nuances seem obvious, others are difficult to understand, and it is hard to tell when a treat becomes an overindulgence. However, if you leave the boring research to us, we will be sure to serve you with both healthy and tasty meals to fulfil both your mind and body.</p>
	
	<h3>Your Stomach</h3>
	<p>Throughout the process of digestion, your stomach releases chemical compounds known as free radicals into your body, which are strong oxidizing agents. Oxidizing agents can damage surrounding tissues, which may slowly but surely increase the chances of cancer for some. Many plant-based foods are rich with antioxidants, which react with these free radicals before they can oxidize anything important in your body. By the time some other animal has eaten the plants, these antioxidants have already been used up, so it is important to maintain a plant rich diet.</p>

	<h3>Your Body</h3>
	<p>The greater fiber content in plant based foods can keep you satiated for longer periods of time. Because fibers cannot be digested by the human body, they slow digestion down, making you feel full for longer. This also means you maintain a steadier blood sugar level, with less peaks and crashes. All of these factors can help you maintain a healthy diet, lose weight, and avoid impulse eating for a healthier, more fulfilled lifestyle. </p>
	
	
	<h2>The Environment</h2>
	<p>Eating more vegitarian food prevents greater climate change for the sake of meat farming. Plants require less space to grow humanely, and thus require less deforestation. They do not release as much waste, and their waste goes directly into the soil, so they make for less carbon emmissions. In fact, by photosynthesizing, plants will decrease carbon dioxide content in the air. </p>
	
	<h3>The Biosphere</h3>
	<p>Commercial livestock farming greatly infringes upon the natural ecosystems existent upon farmlands. Because plants take far less space to (humanely) raise than livestock, a greater dependence on plant based foods reduces the amount of harm done to the existing ecosystem. Along with this, native plants are much easier to safely domesticate without creating overdependence issues than native animals, which would reduce the weight of this issue drastically.</p>
	
	<h3>The Atmosphere</h3>
	<p>The emmissions from livestock amount to 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emmissions. Not only do livestock emit carbon dioxide, but they also emit ammonia, which is highly flammable and more dangerous to life. Not only do plants emit a fraction of the carbon dioxide, they also convert much of it back into oxygen through photosynthesis. </p>
	
	<h4>Along with vegitarian food options, the world needs quality vegitarian food.</h4>
	<p>Oftentimes, vegitarian food is opposed due to its lack of complete proteins. Some choose to ignore this discrepancy. However, by accounting for the nutrient nuances for you, we can assure that you don't have to stress over macros and micros while eating.</p>
