		<p> First, we hire local farmers to work only for us. They grow the fruits, vegetables, and spices we require to make our dishes. Using traditional organic methods, their produce are of the finest quality. This quality is especially important for us as we seek to ensure that you enjoy the richest taste in our vegetarian cuisine. This farm to table method allows us to help with environmental sustainability and reduce carbon footprints. </p>

		<p> The fresh produce of farmers is packed into our transportation trucks that bring the produce to our kitchen as quickly as possible so that you get the finest quality of vegetables. This guarantees that none of our produce has spoiled and you are getting the best possible food. Moreover, our transportation trucks are cleaned regularly, reducing the risk of germs in the produce. These trucks also do not transport any meat and are used only for our restaurant to make sure that no meat enters our kitchen. </p>

		<p> After the produce arrives at our kitchen, we first rinse the vegetables well to make certain that no germs can enter your food. We always wash our hands before handling fresh produce to ensure that germs that we might carry do not contaminate the produce. We realize that fruits and vegetables get easily contaminated and we take the necessary precautions for the safety of our customers. We can garuantee that our food has no germs and we use extensive methods to ensure that customers are not exposed to foodborne illnesses. </p>

Our sanitation methods help improve your food safety and our team strives to meet the sanitation goals. Our chefs are the best and our staff is well trained to serve all your needs in the best possible manner. Our restaurant prioritizes customer service to ensure that you have a good time with your family and friends with us. </p>
